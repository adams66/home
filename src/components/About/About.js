My interest in web development started when I took a css course and I haven't stopped from there. I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.</p>
                
                <p className="paragraphs margin-bottom-20">My experience consists of creating responsive layouts with the power of html, css, and javascript. I also have experience working with databaes and API integrations using technologies like php and mysql.</p>
